I am starting this week quite late due to life, but I was able to give the readings for this week an early skim and then a more full read with the annotation software and such fully active. However, as I was unfamiliar with the material going in, the skimming was very useless. 

I immediately like Zotero

Everything seems to be working fine, the work this week has been quite smooth.

	Note to self: script blockers do not interact well with trying to run scripts, try to turn them off.

I started the process of making the website, but at the moment I have little use for it. I got to the stage where you would enter a domain name and just decided I don’t really want a website yet. I might make one later if there is something particularly fancy I’m trying to do. 

I spoke too soon about ‘quite smooth’, the Firefox bookmarklet is giving me problems again. 

	note to self: If you want to see the notes while reading on the open access site, simply click the paragraphs while 		reading

	Note to self: reading instructions is good…

While it fixed some of the issues, actually knowing what you are doing fixed less then expected.

Particular problem: the Firefox bookmarklet is not bringing up the menu in particular for the twitter thread, it’s working most other places but after some troubleshooting, I have no idea why it’s not.

30 mins in, I just decided to give up and download chrome. Google, Stackx, and a few other sites I briefly looked at all failed, and after asking a couple other people, they told me it was less work to just dl a differnt browser. Reinstalls, running things in new windows, with the original site open/closed and a few other basic tests like this mostly failed. The bookmarklet ran on the carleton website, course website, the two other articles and google, but more advanced websites like twitter seem to block it or something. 

Using the extension instead, as expected, fixed all the issues. Most of the week’s work is now done

	Question to self: Seeing as Opera is essentially a chrome fork, will the extension run on it? 
	Question to self: will .is work on the web version of discord? 
		Answer to both: yes, and even at the same time. Very little effort needed, actually. Opera seems to work just as 		well as Chrome. As I don’t like Chrome, I will probably use that as a secondary browser instead.
