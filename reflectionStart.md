After climbing at least 50 miles uphill, both ways, I have managed to actually start the coursework for week one. 

The overall project is going to be titled 'liberalism' 

At this point, my vague plan is to sketch out the ideological history of liberalism. I want to look at where it came from, what parts of it are formative, what parts are 'core' and how the changing of eras has created a separate epistemes, and the relations between branches of liberalism.

I think liberalism is important to understand, because as western educated people, the basic assumptions that liberalism puts forward are pretty deeply entrenched. As a part of understanding our own though, recognizing our epistemological assumptions is important.

Additionally, I think the language of power and politics is a more accurate way to understand ideological eras then, for example, a more pure look at the evolution of epistemological philosophy. This approach draws from my experience working with IPE. 

While the history of ideology is necessarily a work of political economy as well as history, I intend for this project to follow the patterns of historical work, from citation style to writing biases.
